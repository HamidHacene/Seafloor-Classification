# Seafloor-Classification
## Overview

Huge databases of submarine active acoustic data (echogram) have been collected along the West African coast,  essentially for fish stock estimation. This task is usually done with echo integration. But the first step is to clearly identify the bottom position on the echogram.  Automatic procedures to detect the bottom depth are not successful when the echogram is unclear, it occurs when the bottom texture is soft or when high-density of fish is present near the seabed. Thus, human expertise is required to review and adjust the bottom prediction made by basic procedures. This data labeling task is typically expensive because all the dataset has to be reviewed. This work aims to use deep learning techniques to classify the echogram, because those models have proven to reach good performance on large datasets, and are able to extract knowledge from complex data. Hence we train a neural network procedure to classify the echogram in different categories depending on whether the bottom is present or not in the echogram and whether it is clear or unclear, i.e. need expert correction. The end goal is to help the expert focus only on the portion of the echogram that needs to be corrected and reduce the total cost of the data labeling process.
